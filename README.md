# Error Fixing Simulator
This is a simple game program that simulates a computer that can't run its init executable.
It's up to you to identify and fix the problem.

> :warning: **This is not an accurate simulator.** This program was written specifically for fun and is not entirely rooted in reality, though it does take inspiration from real fatal system errors.

You need at least **Python 3.6** to run this game.
